			<h1>Welcome to Bulbaleague!</h1>
			Bulbaleague is Bulbagarden's personal Pokemon League, with our own Elite Four and Champion. Every so often we hold a tournament to determine which lucky few get to challenge our E4 and, if they beat the E4, to challenge the Champ. Those who manage to defeat our League can then take one of the Elite Four or Champion titles for themselves, depending on how well they did against the current E4/Champ. They will then be displayed in our <a href='./halloffame.php'>Hall of Fame</a> for all to see.<br>
			<br>
			Our tournament is fought in <a href='https://play.pokemonshowdown.com'>Pok√©mon Showdown</a> using Gen 7 (US/UM singles) OU tier, and the tourney is discussed on <a href='https://discord.gg/bulbagarden'>Bulbagarden's Discord server</a> in the #bulbaleague channel. We use the replays feature from Showdown to confirm the winners of each matchup. Some of these replays will even be displayed on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/Bulbagarden'>our YouTube channel</a>.<br>
